The University Centre runs activities for undergraduate and postgraduate students on Saturday afternoons and evenings.

Conferences and activities hosted in Dunreath include medical ethics, philosophy and law seminars.

In collaboration with [Citywise (Scotland),](http://www.citywise.org/) university students can volunteer to give a few hours each week to help in the educational and social development of young people aged 10-15 living in inner city areas.
